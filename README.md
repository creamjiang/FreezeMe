FreezeMe
========

WoT 2012 Hackaton App for frozen food management!
Based on the http://evrythng.net API and the ThngDroid https://github.com/webofthings/ThngDroid/ Android REST library.

This app demonstrates:
* How to connect real-world objects to the Web through NFC and QR codes
* How to turn your Android App into an NFC / QR code reader in a few lines of code
* How to use the EVRYTHNG services to track your food items and give them an active digital identity on the Web

All these points are documented in the source code. Enjoy!
