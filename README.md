This is an example Android app reading QR, barcodes and NFC tags, based on the [EVRYTHNG API](https://api.evrythng.com) and its [Android / Java wrapper](https://github.com/evrythng/evrythng-tools)

This app demonstrates:
* How to connect real-world objects to the Web through NFC and QR codes
* How to turn your Android App into an NFC / QR code reader in a few lines of code
* How to use the EVRYTHNG services to track your food items and give them an active digital identity on the Web

All these points are documented in the source code. Enjoy!
